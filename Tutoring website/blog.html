                    <h2>Find Your Spark: The Power of Motivation in Learning</h2>
                    <p>
                      Learning is a journey filled with challenges, triumphs, and moments of growth. But let’s be honest—it’s not always easy to stay motivated. Whether it’s tackling a tough math problem or preparing for an important exam, the key to success lies in finding your spark and keeping it alive.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>The Importance of Staying Motivated</h3>
                    <p>
                      Motivation is what turns dreams into action. It helps you push through tough days, keeps you focused on your goals, and builds the resilience to overcome obstacles. Remember: 
                      <span style="color: #f44336;">success isn’t about being perfect</span>; it’s about showing up and trying, even when things get hard.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Tips to Stay Inspired</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Set Realistic Goals:</strong> Break your big dreams into smaller, achievable steps. Celebrate every milestone—it’s progress that matters!
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Find Your "Why":</strong> Ask yourself: Why do I want to succeed? Whether it’s pursuing your passion, making your family proud, or building a brighter future, let your "why" fuel your efforts.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Surround Yourself with Positivity:</strong> Your environment matters. Seek out mentors, friends, and tutors who believe in you and uplift you. As they say, 
                        <span style="color: #4caf50;">positivity is contagious</span>.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>Learn from Challenges:</strong> Don’t fear failure—it’s part of the process. Every mistake is an opportunity to grow stronger and wiser. 
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Great things come from perseverance.</span>
